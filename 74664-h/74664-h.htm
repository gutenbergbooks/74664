<h1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE THIRD BATTALION, FIRST PUNJAB REGIMENT</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="smaller">“SHOLINGHUR,” “CARNATIC”</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">December 10th, 1776: Formation.</div>

<p>Owing to a threatened invasion of the Carnatic by
the Mahrattas, the growing power of Hyder
Ali of Mysore, and war with the French, it
was considered necessary to increase the
troops of the Madras Government. The
native portion of the army then consisted of
eight battalions, and eight more were raised, the
present 3rd Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment being
formed by drafts from the other battalions and
designated the 16th Carnatic Battalion or “Lane’s”
Battalion. Captain Thomas Lane was the first Commandant,
and Ensign James Richardson the first
Adjutant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778.</div>

<p>The Battalion remained at Trichinopoly,
where it was raised, until 1778, when it joined
the main army under Sir Hector Munro for the
reduction of the French Settlement of Pondicherry.
This place was invested on August 8th and capitulated
on October 17th. The Battalion’s casualties were:—Killed—1
sergeant, 1 naik, 19 sepoys. Wounded—1
lieutenant, 5 havildars, 2 naiks, 1 drummer, 26 sepoys.
A total of 56.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>The 16th was one of the battalions left to garrison
the town and to assist in dismantling the defences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780: Defence of Permacoil Fort.</div>

<p>In September, 1780, Hyder Ali, the Sultan
of Mysore, invaded the Carnatic in alliance
with the French. The Battalion, less one
company under Lieutenant Bishop at
Permacoil Fort, joined the main army
which marched to Conjeeveram, with the
object of joining hands with a detachment under
Colonel Baillie, which was marching from Guntoor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of Colonel Baillie’s Detachment.</div>

<p>This detachment was attacked by Hyder
Ali within eight miles of the main army.
Sir Hector Munro sent a force, consisting of
the flank companies of the army, to rescue
Colonel Baillie, but the entire detachment
was either killed or taken prisoner to
Seringapatam. The army, thus reduced, was forced
to retire to Madras, with the loss of baggage, being
harassed the whole way by the Mysore Cavalry. Sir
Hector Munro was relieved of his command for not
having supported Colonel Baillie with his whole army
instead of with a detachment only. Sir Eyre Coote
took over command and formed the army into three
divisions, the Battalion being placed in the 2nd (or
Left) Division under Colonel Lord MacLeod.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781: “Carnatic”.</div>

<p>Arrangements having been made for the
supply of the army, it marched from The
Mount on January 17th, strength 7,450
(including 1,600 Europeans) and 62 guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relief of Permacoil.</div>

<p>The first object was the relief of various
forts besieged by Hyder Ali, among them
Permacoil, held by one company of the 16th.
This was effected. Lieutenant Bishop was
noted for immediate promotion for the gallant manner
in which he had carried out the defence, but this was
disallowed by the Directors of the Company as contrary
to the established custom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Cuddalore.</div>

<p>After several skirmishes, Hyder Ali made
a general attack on the British while they
were in camp near Cuddalore. This was
repulsed, the 16th Battalion being cited in
orders as having behaved especially well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Porto Novo.</div>

<p>The Army continued its march southwards,
and found the united armies of
Hyder Ali and the French, under Lally, in
position near Porto Novo on July 1st. The
enemy numbered 60,000 regulars with 47 guns and
120,000 irregulars. Coote attacked the enemy’s left
flank, which was broken, and caused the general defeat
of the enemy. The 16th was in the second line under
General Stuart, which covered the left of the attack
and finally repulsed the cavalry under Lally, which
made a desperate final attempt to break the British line.</p>

<p>The casualties were:—Killed: European, 19;
Native, 64. Wounded: European, 38; Native, 198.
Missing: European, 1; Native, 18. Total, 338.</p>

<p>The Battalion’s losses were:—Killed: 1 European
drummer and 3 rank and file. Wounded: Ensign
John Haynes, 2 subadars, 2 havildars, and 20 rank and
file. Missing: 1. Total, 30.</p>

<p>Coote especially praised the steadiness and spirited
behaviour of the Sepoy Corps.</p>

<p>The victory could not be followed up owing to lack of
cavalry and supplies, but it broke the spell and terror
of Hyder’s name.</p>

<p>The army now moved north to effect a junction with
the Bengal detachment, which was marching down the
coast. This having been accomplished, the whole force
returned to St. Thomas’ Mount on August 8th, and was
reorganized into five brigades. The 16th was placed
in the 2nd Brigade, Colonel Ross Lang, Right Wing,
under Sir Hector Munro.</p>

<p>On August 16th the whole army marched, and
having taken Tripasore, continued its westerly advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Pollilore.</div>

<p>The whole strength of the enemy was
found in position at Pollilore, on the same
ground on which Baillie’s detachment had
been destroyed the previous year. The
effective British strength was 11,000 and that of Hyder
Ali and the French 150,000 (regulars and irregulars),
with 80 guns. Coote attacked and penetrated the
enemy’s centre with his right wing, while his left
outflanked the enemy’s right. A general retreat of
the enemy then commenced.</p>

<p>The British casualties were:—Killed: Europeans,
24; Native, 105. Wounded: European, 54; Native,
207. Missing: Native, 63. Total, 453.</p>

<p>Again the lack of cavalry, supplies, and transport
prevented the victory being exploited, and the army
fell back on Tripasore on August 29th.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Sholinghur.</div>

<p>The Fort at Vellore, which was besieged
by the enemy, being in urgent need of relief,
Coote with great difficulty collected sufficient
transport and rations to march with this
object on September 21st.</p>

<p>Hyder Ali was holding a pass through the Sholinghur
Hills on the direct road with his whole army. The
British army arrived at the pass on September 27th,
and at once attacked. Hyder Ali did not realize that
the British were seriously attacking. The 2nd Brigade
and the Cavalry were sent to turn the enemy’s left
flank while the rest of the army attacked frontally.
The attack was entirely successful and the enemy fled
in disorder after the defeat of the Mysore Cavalry.
The strengths of the opposing armies were: British,
11,500; Mysore, 150,000, and 70 guns. The British
casualties were only 20 killed, 58 wounded and 9
missing.</p>

<p>Owing to the continual dissensions between the civil
and military authorities, an efficient supply and transport
service was impossible. Government also would
not sanction the raising of cavalry. So for the third
time in this year decisive victory was missed. Coote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
declared that he would rather have had five days’ rice
than the trophies and credit of the victory.</p>

<p>In 1889 the battle honour “Sholinghur” was
sanctioned for the Battalion in commemoration of its
services in this battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relief of Vellore.</div>

<p>Vellore having been relieved on November
3rd, the army returned to Madras,
where it arrived on December 3rd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defence of Tripasore.</div>

<p>Tripasore, the main base of the army,
was attacked by Hyder, but held out until
relieved, the garrison being under the
command of Lieutenant Bishop, of the
Battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782: Relief of Vellore.</div>

<p>Early in January it again became
necessary to relieve Vellore, to effect which
the army marched on the 2nd, and, after
some fighting, the place was relieved on
the 11th. Hyder intercepted the return
march, but on two occasions refused battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrender of Permacoil.</div>

<p>In May the Fort of Permacoil, held by a
company of the Battalion under Lieutenant
Plaw, was forced to surrender.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relief of Wandewash and Battle of Arnee.</div>

<p>Owing to the continued lack of transport
the army was practically immobile, and Hyder Ali
laid siege to Wandewash and other forts. To draw
him off Coote marched towards Arnee,
Hyder’s principal depot. This had the
desired effect and the British were overtaken
on June 2nd, about three miles from
Arnee. The rear guard held the enemy
until the army was formed up, when the
whole line advanced and drove the enemy back. The
advance had to be stopped for a time owing to an
attack by 11,000 cavalry on the baggage, which was
covered by the 2nd Brigade. This being repulsed, the
advance continued until the exhaustion of the infantry
called a halt. There being no cavalry, the pursuit
could not be continued. The army later fell back on
Madras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Owing to ill-health, Sir Eyre Coote handed over
command to Brigadier-General Stuart in September,
and returned to Bengal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783.</div>

<p>Reinforcements of British troops having
arrived from England, the army was reformed in
January, the 16th being placed in the 3rd
Brigade, 1st Line. Hyder Ali died in this year and was
succeeded by his son, Tippoo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack on Cuddalore.</div>

<p>The army marched south on February 4th and came
up with the united forces of Tippoo and the French
near Neddingol. The enemy refused battle, and the
army marched to the relief of Vellore. This effected,
it moved in a leisurely way to Cuddalore,
where it arrived on June 7th. Coote,
who had returned to command, died on
April 27th, to the grief and consternation
of the army, especially of the native portion.</p>

<p>Cuddalore was attacked, but, owing to the faulty
timing of the three columns, the attacks were not
simultaneous and were brought to a standstill. The
British lost—Europeans: Killed, 165; wounded, 428.
Natives: Killed, 60; wounded, 292; of which the
Battalion sustained 6 killed and 36 wounded. The
force on either side is supposed to have been 11,000.</p>

<p>The situation was critical, especially as the fleet had
been so badly damaged by the French, under Suffren,
that it was forced to retire on Madras. Fortunately,
at this juncture, news was received that peace had been
declared on July 2nd.</p>

<p>General Stuart was relieved of the command, and
was succeeded by Colonel Ross Lang.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of Palghatcherry and Coimbatore.</div>

<p>The Battalion now formed part of a force
which was sent south and captured Palghatcherry
and Coimbatore. It was then
to advance on Seringapatam from the
South.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784.</div>

<p>Everything was ready, but the orders
were countermanded owing to a truce with Tippoo.
The army dispersed, but had no sooner done so than it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
was ordered to reassemble owing to Tippoo having
refused to sign. This had the desired effect, but it
was not till March 11th, 1784, that peace was
finally declared. In this year the designation
of the Battalion was changed to the 16th Madras
Battalion.</p>

<p>For services during the campaigns of 1780-84 the
battle honour “Carnatic” was granted to the Battalion
in 1889.</p>

<span class="smaller">“MYSORE,” “SERINGAPATAM”</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">1789.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1790: “Mysore.”</div>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Cheyur.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Surrender of Erode.</div>

<p>The Battalion was employed on ordinary garrison
duty until 1789, when it joined a force operating
against some insurgent zamindars in Southern
India. At the end of the year, owing to an
expected outbreak of war with Tippoo, it formed part
of the army assembling at Wallajabad with the
intention of entering Mysore from the
south. Coimbatore and other places in
this district were occupied, the Battalion
being with the 1st Native Brigade, which
took the Fort of Suttiamungalum, which it garrisoned.
On September 11th Tippoo suddenly descended the
Guzzlehutty Pass with 40,000 men. Information of
this move had been received, but was disbelieved at
headquarters, and the detachment was ordered to hold
on. After holding off the attack of Tippoo, it was
decided to retire at daybreak on the 14th,
but the detachment was overtaken and a
battle ensued at Cheyur, in which the
Brigade lost 148 Europeans and 408 natives
killed and wounded. Six guns and all the baggage
were lost, but the enemy was checked.
Erode, which was held by a company of the
Battalion under a subadar, was forced to
surrender on September 25th.</p>

<p>Tippoo, hearing of a concentration at Vellore,
marched north unobserved, and was not followed by
the army until November 8th. The Battalion with
the 1st Europeans, 14th and 20th Battalions, was left
to hold the Coimbatore District with headquarters at
Palghatcherry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege and Surrender of Coimbatore.</div>

<p>The enemy sent a force which besieged Coimbatore
in June. The siege was raised by a force consisting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
of the Battalion and some local levies, and
a company was left to strengthen the
garrison. In October the enemy again
attacked Coimbatore and an attempt to
relieve the place having failed, it surrendered
after a defence of a month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792.</div>

<p>In December orders were received to clear the
district. This was done, and by March, 1792, the force
had, with great difficulty, reached the head of
the Guzzlehutty Pass, but was ordered to
retire as peace had been made.</p>

<p>The battle honour “Mysore” was granted to the
Battalion in 1889, for services during the campaigns
of 1790-92.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793.</div>

<p>War was declared against France in 1793,
and volunteers from the Battalion formed part
of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion for the expedition
against Mauritius, but this was abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795.</div>

<p>In 1795 war was declared against Holland,
and one company embarked as part of a volunteer
battalion which proceed to Malacca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796.</div>

<p>In 1796 the Madras Army was reorganized,
the Battalion becoming the 2nd Battalion of the
5th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797.</div>

<p>The Battalion embarked in 1797 for an
expedition against Manilla, but was recalled
from Penang owing to instructions from England

<div class="sidenote">1799: Capture of Seringapatam.</div>

<p>Tippoo became restless and in 1798 an army
was ordered to concentrate at Vellore under
General Harris. The Battalion was in the
6th Brigade, Left Wing. The army advanced in
February, 1799, and after some minor actions encamped
two miles south-west of Seringapatam on
April 5th. After much fighting against
the enemy’s advanced posts, which were
gradually captured, the breaching batteries
were established by May 2nd. By May 4th
a practicable breach had been made, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
assault was ordered for one o’clock that afternoon.
The Battalion was on duty in the trenches on that day,
the assaulting troops being formed of the flank companies
of the battalions off duty. The troops in the
trenches formed the “sustaining” corps. The assault
was entirely successful after severe fighting. Tippoo
himself was killed. The casualties were:—Europeans:
Killed, 181; wounded, 622. Natives: Killed, 119;
wounded, 420; missing, 100; of which total the
Battalion sustained 11 killed and 33 wounded.</p>

<p>The battle honour of “Seringapatam” was subsequently
granted to the Battalion for this campaign.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">1800.</div>

<p>During the next few years the Battalion was employed
in settling the country and subduing refractory
chiefs, and so did not take part in the Mahratta
War under Sir Arthur Wellesley.</p>

<p>In 1824 its designation was changed to the 16th Regiment
of Madras Native Infantry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824.</div>

<p>Until March, 1824, the Battalion was on
ordinary garrison duty in various parts of
Mysore and the Nizam’s dominions, when it
embarked for service in Burma and joined the force
assembling at Chittagong for the conquest of the
province of Arracan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825: “Ava.”</div>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Arracan.</div>

<p>The force marched in February, 1825, and
after great hardships arrived in front of the
principal Burmese outpost at Mahattee. A
detachment of the Battalion was employed
on board the flotilla accompanying the force and was
present at the repulse at Chanballa. The main force
took the advanced Burmese positions on March 26th
and 27th and halted upon the enemy’s main position
covering the town of Arracan on the 28th. On the
29th the assault was carried out by the light companies
of the 54th Foot, 10th and 16th Madras
Native Infantry, supported by six companies
of the Battalion under Captain
French. The assault went forward in spite
of the steepness of the ascent, and the well-directed
fire of the enemy. The leading men got their hands
on the trench, but were unable to maintain their
position owing to the incessant shower of large stones.
Nevertheless, the attack was maintained until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Captain French had been killed and every other officer
wounded, when the troops were recalled. The force
had lost 28 killed and 114 wounded, of which the
Regiment had Captain French and 10 other ranks killed
and Lieutenants Luard, White, and Gledstanes and
31 other ranks wounded.</p>

<p>Batteries were constructed, and at 11.30 p.m. on
the 30th an assault was carried out, which was entirely
successful, and the city was occupied the next day.</p>

<p>A force consisting of the light companies of the 44th
and 54th Foot and of the 16th Madras Native Infantry,
and four companies of the 1st Bengal Light Infantry
Battalion, marched in May, 1825, to endeavour to find
a route across to the Irrawaddi River, by which the
force at Arracan could join hands with the main army
from Rangoon. After terrible hardships they were
forced to return, nearly every man being sick. The
unhealthiness of the country may be judged by the fact
that on October 1st, 1825, the Battalion only had 108
men fit for duty and 644 sick. Between June 16th,
1824, and January 31st, 1826, the Battalion lost by
death 7 officers, 5 native officers, and 148 other ranks
and 15 followers. Some Battalions did not have a
single man available for duty.</p>

<p>The expedition had been successful in the conquest
of the province of Arracan, but failed in its principal
object, that of penetrating to the valley of the Irrawaddy.</p>

<p>The troops were withdrawn later, the Battalion
landing in Madras in January, 1826, and proceeding to
Vellore.</p>

<p>The battle honour “Ava” was granted for services
in this campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830.</div>

<p>In 1830 the 16th was one of the Battalions
selected to have a rifle company, on the disbandment
of the Madras Rifle Corps.</p>

<p>From 1826 to 1839 the Battalion was employed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the ordinary routine of garrison duty in various parts
of the Madras Presidency and Hyderabad
State. In the latter year it formed part of
the force under Major-General Wilson for
the reduction of the fort and petty sovereignty
of Kurnool. This having been effected, the
Battalion was left to garrison the fortress until 1843,
when it was ordered to Belgaum in the Southern
Mahratta country, to replace the Bombay troops
employed in the conquest of Scinde. While
stationed there, the Rifle Company greatly distinguished
itself in the Light Field Force
under Major-General Delamotte, employed
in suppressing the insurgents in the Sawunt
Warree country, and took part in the capture
of several forts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845.</div>

<p>Privates Cotapah and Veerapah were

distinguished conduct at the unsuccessful attack on
the stockade in the Pass of Sasseedroog.
The former was also presented with a gold
medal by the City of Perth for protecting
and bringing off the body of Lieutenant
Campbell of the Bombay European Light Infantry.
Private Hyder Ally Khan was also admitted to the
Third Class Indian Order of Merit for distinguished
gallantry, while Lieutenant Francis Mardale received
the thanks of the Commander-in-Chief and Government
of Bombay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1855.</div>

<p>The Battalion was on garrison duty in various parts
of the Bombay Presidency and Southern India
until 1853, when it proceeded to Aden, returning
to India in 1855.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Azimghur.</div>

<p>On the outbreak of the Mutiny of the Bengal
Army in 1857, the Battalion volunteered
for service against the mutineers and was
thanked by the Government. The Rifle
Company under Lieutenants Bates and Gray
formed part of the Madras Rifles, commanded by
Major Carr, of the 16th. The Company took part in
several actions, notably that at Azimghur
on April 6th, 1858, up to the end of the
Mutiny. The Company rejoined Battalion
headquarters at Hurryhur in April, 1860.</p>

<p>Seven non-commissioned officers and privates were
admitted to the Third Class of the Indian Order of

<div class="sidenote">1858: Operations in North Canara.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1859.</div>

<p>In 1858, while the Regiment was stationed
at Mangalore, a detachment of it formed part
of a force under Captain Walpole, of the
16th, for the suppression of an insurrection
in North Canara. After ten months of very
harassing duty, the rebellion was put
down and the detachment rejoined the
Battalion at Hurryhur in January, 1859.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1865.</div>

<p>In 1865, while stationed at Madras, the
reorganization of the army took place consequent
on the transfer to the Crown of the forces
of the East India Company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1868.</div>

<p>The Battalion proceeded to Burma in 1866
and returned to India in 1868.</p>

<p>Up to 1886 the Battalion was employed on garrison
duty in various parts of the Madras Presidency and of
the Central Provinces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1886: Burma</div>

<p>In July, 1886, the Battalion, which was
then at Vizianagram, was ordered to
embark for active service in Burma, and
crossed the frontier on August 1st. The 16th formed
part of the 3rd Brigade, Upper Burma Field Force,
under Brigadier-General Anderson, and was employed
in various parts of Upper Burma, chiefly on detachment,
and took part in much desultory fighting.</p>

<p>During the campaign the following casualties were
incurred: 1 British officer killed and 1 wounded,
5 other ranks killed and 3 wounded. In 1887, 61 non-commissioned
officers and men died of disease; total
deaths from this cause on service were 102.</p>

<p>The battle honour of “Burma, 1885-87” was
granted for this campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1888.</div>

<p>In February, 1888, the Battalion went into
garrison at Mandalay until March, 1889, when
it returned to India and was stationed at
Secunderabad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1895.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1900.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1903.</div>

<p>The Battalion again proceeded to Burma
in 1895, being stationed at Rangoon until
December, 1898, when it returned to India
and was stationed at Berhampore. There it remained
until January, 1900, when it embarked for
Singapore, in relief of British troops who had
been sent to South Africa. Returning to
India in November, 1901, the Battalion was stationed
at Madras until May 16th, 1903, when it was
transferred to Secunderabad to be reconstituted
as a Punjab regiment with the designation
“76th Punjabis.” Thus, after an honourable
existence of more than 130 years, the Battalion ceased
to exist as a purely Madras Battalion.</p>

<p>The Colours, mess plate, and band instruments were
handed over to the new Battalion, and Lieut.-Colonel
J. Jackson, of the old 16th, was appointed Commandant.
Drafts of about two hundred non-commissioned
officers and men were received from various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Punjab Battalions and the new Battalion recruited up
to full strength, the majority of the British officers
being those of the 16th Madras Infantry.</p>

<p>The new composition of the Battalion was:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Two companies of Sikhs.</li>
<li>Two companies of Hindu Jats.</li>
<li>Four companies of Punjabi Mussalmans.</li>
</ul>

<p>The uniform remained scarlet, but the facings were
changed to emerald green from yellow.</p>

<p>In this year sanction was accorded for General
Officers, who had been previously connected with
Battalions of the Indian Army, being appointed
Honorary Colonels thereof. Accordingly Major-General
Henry S. Elton, who had formerly served for
thirty-two years in the 16th Madras Infantry, was
appointed the first Honorary Colonel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1904.</div>

<p>By the end of 1904, the Battalion was reported
fit for service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1908.</div>

<p>In March, 1908, the Battalion proceeded to
Tientsin, North China, for garrison duty, finding
detachments at Chinwangtao and Shanhaikwan.
It returned to India in 1911 and was stationed
at Jhelum.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">1914.</div>

<p>Orders were received to mobilize, as for service
in Europe, on October 21st, and the Battalion
mobilized to full strength plus ten per cent.
in seventy-two hours. A draft of 120 men of
the 87th Punjabis, under Captain S. M. H. Baillie,
was sent to the Battalion in place of its own
reservists, who could not be called up in time. A
depot was left in Jhelum under Captain E. Milford.</p>

<p>The Battalion embarked at Karachi on October 31st
as part of the 30th Indian Infantry Brigade, under
Major-General C. J. Melliss, V.C., which comprised
the 24th Punjabis, 126th Baluchistan Infantry, and
2/7th Gurkha Rifles. The Brigade disembarked at
Suez and took over the defence of the Little Bitter
Lake-Suez Section of the Suez Canal, on which the
Battalion found various posts with Headquarters at
Suez. On the Turks threatening attack the whole
Battalion took up position on the canal banks. Beyond
one or two very small actions and one reconnaissance
by two companies into the desert, no fighting took place
in this sector.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1915.</div>

<p>On March 13th the 28th Brigade relieved the
30th, which concentrated at Suez for embarkation.
The Brigade sailed from Suez on March
22nd, and great disappointment was felt that it was
sailing southwards instead of northwards to France,
as had been expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>On April 7th the Battalion arrived at Basra and
went into camp at Makina, where the Brigade was
concentrating as part of the newly-formed 12th
Division.</p>

<p>On April 12th the Brigade attempted to reinforce
the garrison of Shaiba by wading through mud and
water across the inundated country between Zobeir
Gate and Old Basra but, owing to the farther bank
being strongly held by the enemy, was ordered to
retire when half-way across. Several attempts to
cross by bellum were made, but priority had to be
given to urgently required ammunition and rations,
so the Battalion remained in bivouac at Zobeir Gate.
Detachments were provided to protect the bellum
convoys and drive off hostile craft.</p>

<p>After Shaiba the Battalion returned to Makina
Camp and a few days later embarked for Ahwaz, and
joined the concentration of the 12th Division, under
Major-General Gorringe, at Sabeh on April 28th.</p>

<p>After very hot and waterless marches, the Division
arrived at Illah on the Karkheh river on May 7th. The
Turks were found to have retired, but it was necessary
to punish the Beni Turuf tribe of Arabs. The river was
found to be about 300 yards broad and the bridging
material insufficient, so a flying bridge and canvas
boats were improvised and, thanks greatly to the
exertions of many swimmers of the 66th and 76th, all
men, stores and animals were eventually landed on
the far bank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Khafajiyeh.</div>

<p>On May 13th a column, of which the
Battalion formed part, marched by night
to the cover of some hills facing the Karkheh
river, on the far bank of which was the principal
Beni Turuf village of Khafajiyeh. The morning of
the 14th was spent waiting for the advance of the
12th Brigade up the left bank, which did not arrive
owing to the bad ground it had to move over. At
2 p.m. the 76th and 2/7th Gurkha Rifles advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
towards the river bank, coming under fire from the
village and its fort. The river was found to be 280
yards broad and very swift and, as there was no means
of crossing it, a retirement was ordered at 6 p.m.,
which was closely followed up by the Arabs. Bivouac
was formed about half a mile from the river. The
Battalion had had 11 men wounded during the afternoon.</p>

<p>On the 15th the 2/7th Gurkha Rifles and the 76th
again advanced to the river and, on volunteers being
called for to swim the river, a party did so, led by
Subadar-Major Ajab Khan, under heavy fire from the
fort and opposite bank, supported by the covering
fire of the Battalion.</p>

<p>This party succeeded in emptying the only serviceable
boat to be found on the other bank, under the
close fire of the fort, and swam it across. Major
Perrin’s double-company then proceeded to ferry
across in this boat, and the first party, under Subadar-Major
Ajab Khan and Jemadar Mehdi Khan, stormed
the gate of the fort and forced their way in, driving the
enemy into the buildings or out of the fort, where they
were shot by another party that had arrived, under the
command of Subadar Indar Singh, and had meanwhile
surrounded the fort. Eventually all the enemy were
smoked out of the buildings and killed or captured.
Two double-companies bivouacked in the fort and the
rest of the 76th and the 2/7th Gurkha Rifles bivouacked
on the right bank. For their gallantry on this occasion,
six Indian Orders of Merit and twenty Indian Distinguished
Service Medals were awarded to the Indian
officers and men who took part.</p>

<p>One sepoy was killed, 1 Indian officer, and 11 sepoys
wounded during the day.</p>

<p>The next morning the village was burnt, and two
days later the Battalion started on the return march to
Illah and Ahwaz, whence it proceeded by steamer to
Basra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Second Action of Kurna.</div>

<p>On the 28th May, the Machine Gun Section
and fifty rifles embarked on a river steamer,
under Captain Laing, and took part in the
second action of Kurna, returning to Basra
after the capture of Amarah, in charge of prisoners.</p>

<p>The Battalion proceeded to Kurna by steamer on
June 10th to take part in the 12th Division’s advance
up the Euphrates for the capture of Nasariyeh.
During the stay in Kurna the heat was intense. The
whole brigade was trained daily in boat drill and
formations in case this form of warfare should be
necessary.</p>

<p>Owing to the insanitary conditions in the Basra
bivouac and the heat and mosquitoes in the marshy
ground at Kurna, 270 men went down with fever
before the Regiment left.</p>

<p>On the 26th the expedition started up the Euphrates
in steamers, and crossed the Hammar Lake, where
it was held up by the obstruction of the entrance
to the Hakika channel. This was eventually blown
up by the Sappers and Miners, assisted by swimmers
from the Battalion, and the steamers were hauled
across by working parties amounting to as many as
600 at a time.</p>

<p>Reconnaissances were made up the Gurma Safah
Channel, and the Turkish positions located holding the
junction of the Gurma Safah and Euphrates. The
country was under water except for a narrow strip on
either bank.</p>

<p>On July 4th a short advance was made by the
Battalion to a point known as Ati’s House, whence a
further reconnaissance was made and outposts pushed
forward under the fire of snipers.</p>

<p>The attack was ordered for the 5th, as follows:—The
76th to advance up the left bank, supported by
the 24th Punjabis and 30th Mountain Battery in
boats in the marsh on its right; 2/7th Gurkha Rifles
and 1/4th Hampshire Regiment to advance up the
right bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Gurma Safah (Sukh-es-Sheyuk).</div>

<p>The advance began at 4 a.m. through
thick palm groves and undergrowth, and
at once met with opposition which was
driven back, until the 2/7th on the other
bank were held up by a broad creek, which
could not be crossed. The 76th continued
their advance now enfiladed by the enemy on the other
bank as well as being strongly opposed to their front,
until they were held up by the enemy in position
behind a strong wall extending from the river to the
marsh. Here Lieut.-Colonel Smithett was severely
wounded, and Captain Baillie and Lieutenant Graves
were also wounded. In addition to other casualties,
the whole Machine Gun Section was killed or wounded
and the guns damaged.</p>

<p>The 24th now moved up and outflanked the enemy
through the marsh, causing him to retire, pursued by
half the 76th and the remainder of the 24th, until he
reached his final position across the Euphrates, where
he surrendered. The remaining four companies of the
Battalion were employed in keeping down the fire from
the right bank during the pursuit. The casualties of
the 76th amounted to 2 Indian officers (Jemadars Nur
Khan and Maluka), and 14 men killed, 3 British and
2 Indian officers and 37 men wounded, being about
twenty per cent. of the strength engaged, about 150
men having been left in charge of the Battalion’s boats,
which did not come into action.</p>

<p>On the 6th the force proceeded up river and formed
camp at Asani, about three miles below the Turkish
main position covering Nasariyeh. From here
reconnaissances were made and outposts pushed forward,
and continual sniping took place on both sides.
The heat was intense, and all ranks were exposed day
and night to the elements and every sort of mosquito
and biting insect, there being no tents or cover of any
kind by day or night.</p>

<p>On the night of July 13th-14th an attack was ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
to establish a forward position on the right bank.
Accordingly Major Rybot’s double company, supported
by a company of the 48th Pioneers, attacked and
rushed Shakair, killing most of the garrison and
occupying the village. At the same time the remainder
of the Battalion occupied a grove called “Sixteen
Palms” without opposition, except for snipers, on the
right bank, and the 48th Pioneers entrenched the
position. Our losses at Shakair were 2nd-Lieutenant
Hathorn, Indian Army Reserve of Officers, and 1
sepoy killed, 7 men wounded.</p>

<p>Throughout the 14th the enemy retaliated with
gun and rifle fire, but the forward positions were maintained.
Subadar Neki Ram was wounded at Shakair
during the morning. Till the 23rd preparations were
continued for the assault, enemy sniping being
continuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nasariyeh.</div>

<p>The orders for the attack on July 24th
were as follows:—The 12th Brigade to
assault the enemy position on the left bank
after an intense bombardment, supported by part of
the 18th Brigade. On the position being taken they
were to swing round and enfilade the enemy’s position
on the right bank behind the Medijinah Creek, which
would then be assaulted by the 30th Brigade, supported
by one battalion of the 18th Brigade, and covered by
the artillery. The 30th Brigade was to assault as
follows:—1/4th Hampshire Regiment (only 150 strong)
and 2/7th Gurkhas would advance from the “Sixteen
Palms”—Shakair line, covered by the fire of the
24th Punjabis and massed machine guns. The 76th,
in support, to advance simultaneously a thousand
yards in rear of the Hampshire Regiment and 2/7th
Gurkhas.</p>

<p>At 5.30 a.m., on the 24th, the artillery bombardment
began on the left bank and continued for three-quarters
of an hour, when the 12th Brigade assaulted, and, after
severe hand-to-hand fighting, carried the position. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
7 a.m. the 30th Brigade began their advance under
shell- and heavy rifle-fire from the enemy trenches.
The ground being absolutely devoid of cover, casualties
were heavy. A barge had meanwhile been jammed
across the mouth of the Medijinah Creek. This barge
carried parties of Sappers and Miners and Pioneers
with bridging material and reserve ammunition.
Work was started on two foot bridges over the creek
within 200 yards of the enemy trenches. The artillery
bombardment continued until the Hampshire Regiment
and Gurkhas and 76th had worked their way up to
the bank of the creek. The water was found to be
only waist deep, the flow having been stopped by the
barge. At about 10 a.m. a charge was initiated and
the enemy’s position entered. After some hand-to-hand
fighting, the whole of the position was in our
hands, the enemy streaming across the plain, pursued
by our fire. The supporting battalion of the 18th
Brigade now passed through and took up the pursuit,
while the 30th Brigade reformed and followed closely
after it. The enemy did not stand in his second
position, and was driven out of a third position on the
bank of the river in the evening. The 30th Brigade
bivouacked on his third position.</p>

<p>The Turks left in our hands 17 guns, numerous rifles,
quantities of ammunition and stores. The enemy
losses were 700 killed, 740 wounded, and 200 wounded
prisoners. The Battalion lost Lieutenants Darell
and McElwaine, and Subadar-Major Ajab Khan
wounded, 6 rank and file killed, and 55 wounded out
of about 300 engaged, the 30th Brigade losing 200 out
of a strength of 900. The total British casualties
were 564.</p>

<p>Nasariyeh was occupied on the 25th without further
opposition. During these operations from June 26th
to July 25th the Battalion had lost:—British officers:
1 killed, 5 wounded. Indian officers: 2 killed, 4
wounded. Rank and file: 21 killed and 123 wounded.
Sick: approximately 70. The following decorations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
were subsequently awarded:—Distinguished Service
Order, 1; Military Cross, 1; Indian Order of Merit, 7;
Indian Distinguished Service Medal, 19.</p>

<p>The month of August was spent in bivouac at
Nasariyeh resting, only a few outposts being found by
the Battalion.</p>

<p>At the end of the month, the 30th Brigade, less
the 1/4th Hampshire Regiment, was moved by water
to Amarah to join the 6th Division in their advance up
the Tigris.</p>

<p>Reinforcements were received at Amarah, and
Lieut.-Colonel Smithett rejoined and took command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First Battle of Kut.</div>

<p>The 2/7th Gurkha Rifles and 76th then proceeded,
partly by steamer and partly by march, to join the
concentration of the 6th Division at Sannaiyat. The
camp was shelled by the enemy on September 25th,
and our force advanced and occupied Chahela Mounds
on the 26th with little opposition. The 2/7th and
76th were detailed to guard the left flank and shipping
during the coming battle, and entrenched themselves
in redoubts on the right bank. On the
28th the First Battle of Kut took place.
The Turks were beaten back and the
6th Division occupied Kut-al-Amarah.</p>

<p>The Battalion was left to guard the hospitals and
a few days later marched to Kut.</p>

<p>During the month spent in Kut, drafts were received
from the Depot, and a company of Jats from the 99th
Infantry, under Major Cotton, with 2nd-Lieutenants
Spowart and Rogers, Indian Army Reserve Officers,
brought the Battalion up to full strength again.</p>

the 15th.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Ctesiphon.</div>

<p>The advance on Baghdad commenced on the 19th,
by a move against the Turkish positions at Zeur, but,
after an exhausting day, the enemy was found to have
retired. The main body continued its march to Lajj
the next day, but the 2/7th and 76th were detailed to
escort the shipping round the thickly-wooded Baghailah
bend, and did not arrive at Lajj till the
21st. The same evening the whole force
moved out to attack the enemy in his
position at Ctesiphon. The plan for the
attack was as follows:—(<i>a</i>) One brigade, supported by
the heavy artillery and ships, to attack, with its left on
the river, the enemy position from “High Wall” to
“Water Redoubt.” (<i>b</i>) One and a half brigades to
attack “V.P. Redoubt” (the left of the enemy’s first
line) from the east. (<i>c</i>) One brigade to attack “V.P.”
from the north-east, these being supported by the
Royal Field Artillery Brigade and the Howitzer
Battery. (<i>d</i>) A flying column, consisting of the
Cavalry Brigade, two armoured cars, Machine Gun
Battery and the 76th Punjabis, to attack the left
rear of the enemy, and on his retreating to pursue him
to Baghdad.</p>

<p>The Turkish first line was about six miles in length,
consisting of redoubts heavily wired and connected by
fire trenches. His second line, two to three miles in
rear, was not so thoroughly entrenched. The enemy
numbered 18,000 and 40 guns, the British 13,000 and
32 land guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>The night advance commenced at 7 p.m. on the 21st,
Column “A” moving direct on its objective. “B,”
“C,” and the Flying Columns followed the old Nahrwan
Canal, each column halting on arrival at its allotted
position.</p>

<p>The Flying Column reached its position at 3 a.m.
During the march the Battalion formed the advance
guard. Army transport carts, sufficient for half the
men to ride in, were provided, mainly in order to
facilitate a swift pursuit on the enemy retreating.</p>

<p>At daybreak, the guns with Column “A” could be
heard away to the south-west. A few enemy camel
patrols were rounded up by our cavalry and armoured
cars. Columns “B” and “C” soon after advanced,
and took “V.P.” after fierce fighting. At 8.15 the
Flying Column advanced, cavalry on the right, 76th on
the left, supported by the Machine Gun Battery and
“S” Battery, Royal Horse Artillery.</p>

<p>To quote the official “History of the War in
Mesopotamia”:—</p>

<p>“After advancing about 1,200 yards, the 76th came
under heavy fire from enemy infantry in their front,
and a hot fight ensued. The 76th, behaving with great
gallantry, gained some ground, but the hostile force
opposing them—evidently part of the 51st Division—was
too strong, and about 10 a.m. the further advance
of the 76th was definitely checked and they dug themselves
in. They had suffered heavy casualties, including
the loss of their two senior British officers.”</p>

<p>The cavalry now withdrew to ward off an Arab attack
on the transport and rear of Columns “B” and “C.”
The Battalion had by this time lost severely and any
attempt to advance was at once stopped by enemy
rifle and machine-gun fire. Meantime, many gallant
actions were performed by various men, in bringing up
ammunition and distributing it and bringing the
wounded into the shelter of the shallow entrenchment
that had been made. During this time severe fighting
was taking place in the enemy second line. At about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
4 p.m. the enemy counter-attacked with two fresh
divisions, whose presence was, up to that time, unknown,
and Columns “B” and “C” were finally ejected from
the enemy’s second position.</p>

<p>The right of the Battalion was now attacked by
about two battalions and the flank thrown back to
meet the attack; the enemy advanced to within four
or five hundred yards, where he was stopped. As
darkness fell piquets were pushed forward and to the
right flank, and the Battalion commenced to concentrate
and dig itself in. The enemy showed no signs of
movement. At 7 p.m. orders were received to rejoin
the Brigade at “V.P.,” and this was done, very slowly
and with great difficulty owing to the very large
number of wounded, who had to be carried. On arrival
at “V.P.” the Battalion bivouacked on the enemy’s
first line trenches, and the night passed quietly. The
following extract from the official history serves to
show that the efforts made by all ranks on this memorable
day were not without considerable effect:—“According
to the Turkish account, the five infantry
battalions of the 51st Division here had now all been
absorbed into the firing line, which covered a front of
about four miles. That they could make no further
progress seems to have been due mainly to the stout
fighting qualities of the 76th and the fine work of
“S” Battery.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">November 23rd.</div>

<p>The next day the Battalion was employed
collecting wounded, ammunition and equipment
between the enemy’s first and second
lines, and in keeping off marauding Arabs.
By 3 p.m. it was evident that the enemy was advancing
from the direction of Ctesiphon Arch. The Battalion
was on its way back to High Wall for a much-needed
rest, when it was urgently recalled to reinforce the
troops holding “V.P.” It came under artillery and
rifle fire on the way, and eventually took up a position
in a converted Turkish communication trench, which
it held all night. The Turks appeared to have lost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
their direction, as large bodies were moving about in
the vicinity all night, but no serious attack took place,
any visible movement by them being at once stopped
by our fire. A patrol, under Havildar Neki, carried out
a daring reconnaissance during the night and brought
in valuable information.</p>

<div class="sidenote">November 24th.</div>

<p>Bitter cold was experienced all night, officers and
men being dressed in shirts and shorts only. “V.P.”
was held all the 24th under fire from guns
and snipers, while the wounded were
evacuated to the rear. About 4 p.m. the
24th Punjabis and 2/7th Gurkhas sent up
all their water mules to the Battalion, which was
highly appreciated as the men had had no food or
water, except what they carried, since the night of the
21st. The final retirement to High Wall was covered by
the 76th and the 76th Battery, and was completed
by 6.30 p.m.</p>

<p>The losses of the Battalion during the three days
were very heavy, viz.:—Killed: Major C. L. Perrin,
2nd-Lieutenant Gosney, Indian Army Reserve of
Officers, Subadar Abdullah Khan, Jemadars Saida
Khan and Umrao Singh (99th), and 42 rank and file.
Wounded: Lieut.-Colonel A. C. H. Smithett, 2nd-Lieutenant
Spowart, Indian Army Reserve of Officers
(99th), Subadars Sohan, Mehdi Khan, and Chuni
Ram (99th), Jemadars Sher Singh and Jalal Khan, and
225 rank and file. Missing, 5; died of wounds, 3;
wounded and missing, 2.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Smithett, the Commandant, died of
his wounds on the 25th, to the great regret of all ranks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Retirement to Kut.</div>

<p>During the 25th the wounded were evacuated to
Lajj, one double-company piqueting the road. In
the afternoon dense columns of the enemy
were seen to be advancing, and the force
retired under cover of darkness to Lajj,
where it halted till the 27th. On the 27th
at 4 p.m. the arduous retirement commenced, Aziziyeh
(22 miles) being reached at 8.30 a.m., 28th, the left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
half battalion there covering the bridgehead. On
the 30th the 30th Brigade with the 16th Cavalry and
Howitzer Battery was ordered to move rapidly on
Kut, where the shipping was being held up by the
enemy, and marched at 8 a.m. At 4 p.m. after
covering twenty miles, camp was formed for the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Umm-al-Tubul.</div>

<p>At 6.30 a.m. the Brigade was ordered to march as
fast as possible back to the Division’s
camp at Umm-al-Tubul, which was being
attacked, in order to render it assistance.
On arrival the Battalion came under
shrapnel fire, and, on the division retiring, it took over
the duties of rear guard and marched till 5 p.m., halted
for half an hour, and then continued the retirement to
Monkey Village, which was reached at 12.30 a.m. on
the 2nd, having covered thirty miles. The march was
resumed at 5 a.m., only interfered with by Arab
snipers, and bivouac within three miles of Kut was
reached at 8 p.m., all ranks being exhausted, having
marched seventy miles since 8 a.m. 30th, and been on
the move for forty-eight hours without food. The
cold was bitter and no food or blankets could be
obtained till nearly midnight.</p>

<p>During the retirement one man was killed, one
wounded, and one missing. The strength of the
Battalion on arrival in Kut, under the command of
Major Cotton (99th Infantry, attached), was—Officers:
British, 8; Indian, 13; rank and file, 320.</p>

<p>Of this retirement, the Official History relates:—“For
over twelve days General Townshend’s force—largely
composed of young soldiers—had been fighting,
marching or working continuously, frequently without
sufficient food or water and often deprived of sleep.
This forty-four miles’ march (General Melliss’ Column
did fifty-one miles) coming, under pressure from the
enemy, at the end of this period and carried out in
thirty-six hours, was therefore, a severe test of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
discipline. Their soldierly execution of it must
arouse our admiration and add greatly to the reputation
they had already won.”</p>

<p>The following decorations were subsequently awarded
for these operations:—Distinguished Service Order, 1;
Indian Order of Merit, 1; Indian Distinguished
Service Medal, 2.</p>

<p>Many very deserving rewards could not be granted
owing to the loss of the recommendations during the
siege.</p>

<span class="smaller">KUT</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Siege of Kut.</div>

<p>On the 3rd the force moved into Kut-al-Amarah.
Some sick and lightly wounded men rejoined,
bringing the strength up to about 333.
The 30th Brigade was detailed as reserve
brigade and was allotted camping space in
gardens on the edge of the town.</p>

<p>Work was at once commenced on the defences and
pushed on with the greatest vigour possible. The
Battalion was employed night and day digging the
second line and communication trenches to the front
line.</p>

<p>On December 5th the enemy began to close round
Kut and opened with artillery fire and a few snipers.
The Cavalry Brigade and greater portion of land
transport crossed the river on their way to Ali Gharbi
on the 6th, on which day the last steamer also left, and
Kut was isolated. Work was continued on the
defences to the limit of the men’s endurance. The
enemy strength increased daily and he gradually
closed in on the front line. Intense artillery bombardment
was kept up for about two hours morning and
evening when the mirage disappeared and enabled
observation of fire to be made. On the 9th the enemy
attacked the bridgehead on the right bank and captured
it. Under cover of fire from the left bank it was
temporarily reoccupied, but again captured by the
Turks. After dark the bridge was cut adrift, the
right bank having been occupied in force by the enemy.</p>

<p>The Turkish artillery fire had become so severe by
the 10th that orders were issued to discontinue working
in the open in daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>The usual routine for the reserve brigade was to
move out at dusk, work till 1 a.m., when the units
went into close reserve and support to the front line
till dawn. They then returned to bivouac dug-outs on
the outskirts of the town. After food, work was again
commenced on communications, improving roads,
second line trenches, etc. Return to bivouac for the
evening meal preparatory to moving out again at dusk.
Piquets along the river bank, to prevent entry or
egress of enemy agents, were also found in turn by
night and day by the reserve brigade.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 12th the Turks made a
determined attack on the north-west sector and succeeded
in establishing themselves within a hundred
yards of the front-line trenches, although they failed
to enter them. The same night the 76th moved up
in relief to the front line. This relief of the 16th
Brigade by the 30th Brigade, and vice versa, took
place weekly after this date.</p>

<p>The front line taken over was only of an average
of two and a half feet deep, with no sanitary arrangements,
many dead being just thrown on the parapet or
parados, and no direct communication trenches. The
enemy was extremely active, pushing up his saps and
opening new parallels. At night he was particularly
active, making many attempts on the wire. These
were all driven off by rifle and machine-gun fire and by
bombs, while his working parties were harassed by
fire whenever possible. Our men were kept employed
to the utmost limit of their strength improving the
trenches, etc. During this first tour of duty in the
front line the Battalion lost severely, 2nd-Lieutenant
Muirhead being mortally wounded, Jemadar Ram
Sarup killed, Subadar Sundar Singh wounded, and
about fifty men killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Throughout the siege casualties were of daily
occurrence, there being no place within the defences
which was not under rifle fire. The majority of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
enemy artillery fire was directed at our artillery
positions near the brick kilns, and on the town itself.
The front line received very little artillery fire, and it
was generally less strenuous in the front line than in
reserve, the latter entailing constant working parties
day and night, as well as having to be in close support
on completion of the night’s work. The men only had
the clothes in which they stood up and two blankets,
and consequently soon became lousy, as there was
practically no opportunity of washing, all water having
to be drawn from the river, which was some distance
away and subject to heavy sniping. On December
24th the enemy made a determined attack on the fort,
which he entered, and was only ejected after severe
hand-to-hand fighting at 3 a.m. on the 25th. That
evening the 76th, which was due for relief, received
orders to move into the fort during the night, where it
took over the north and west faces and repaired and
improved the defences. It was again relieved on the
28th and had twenty-fours’ much-needed rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">January, 1916.</div>

<p>Rain commenced falling on January 6th
and added much to the difficulty of keeping
the trenches and communications in good
order, and to the discomfort of the men.
News of the relieving force was now received daily
and gave all ranks a feeling of optimism as to the
early raising of the siege. On January 21st the river
overflowed into the enemy trenches, which in turn
overflowed into ours, and no amount of work could
stop it. A retirement was therefore ordered to the
Middle Line, which had been prepared for occupation
in such an eventuality, but was already two or three
feet deep in mud and water. Ammunition, stores
and kits were moved with great difficulty owing to
the depth of mud and water in the front line and
communication trenches, which was almost up to the
men’s necks. One havildar was drowned trying to
rescue ammunition. The cold was also extreme and
the men, having no means of drying their clothes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
suffered heavily from exposure, 3 British officers
and 50 men having to report sick. The enemy to our
front had been forced by the water to retire 1,500 yards
and valuable firewood was retrieved from his trenches
by parties from the Battalion, after inflicting many
casualties on him as he retired across the open.</p>

<p>On the 29th horsemeat was first issued and all rations
were much reduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">February.</div>

<p>On February 16th a bund twenty feet
thick was commenced all along the trenches
in order to keep out the floods that were
expected in March, and work on this continued nightly
until it was finished.</p>

<p>Enemy aeroplanes also put in frequent appearances,
but in only one case did their bombs cause any damage.
Several schemes for sorties were prepared and the
Battalion actually paraded for some, but they did not
eventually take place. Great difficulty was met with
in getting the men to eat horsemeat and they did
not do so until very near the end of the siege; they did,
however, find many kinds of edible weeds and grass to
cook and supplement the scanty ration. The casualties
in Kut up to the end of February totalled 3,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March.</div>

<p>On March 8th and 9th the Battalion, with
others, was held in readiness to cross the
river, and co-operate with the relief force,
and great was the disappointment when its failure
was made known. On the 10th rations were reduced
to 10 ounces of barley and 4 ounces for parching, and
all surplus animals were killed. On the 15th the
enemy was again flooded out of his trenches. For
some time past the whole British garrison had been
employed daily in making bricks and collecting
materials, and nightly in completing the flood bund.
The flood arrived on the 16th and continued rising
until on the 27th Kut was an island. On the 28th
rations were reduced to 8 ounces, and the same day a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
new problem appeared in the percolation of water
through the ground into the trenches from the flood
outside. This gave serious anxiety and much hard
work to counteract, nearly to the end of the siege.
The men now began to become very weak and
emaciated, but retained their spirits, in which all were
much helped by the constant and distinctly heard
bombardments of the enemy trenches by the relieving
force, whose flashes and bursts could be easily seen at
night.</p>

<p>Casualties of the 76th from the commencement of
the siege to the end of March:—Officers: British—Died
of wounds, 1; wounded, 2. Indian—Killed, 1;
wounded, 4. Rank and File—Killed, 32; died of
wounds, 17; wounded, 90; missing, 2; died of
disease, 16. Followers—Killed, 2; died of wounds, 1;
wounded, 3; total, 171.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.</div>

<p>On April 9th rations were reduced to
7 ounces, on the 10th to 5 ounces, and on the
11th to 4 ounces, when the men at last
overcame their prejudices and commenced eating
horsemeat. Our aeroplanes were now dropping
supplies daily, but were unable to carry sufficient to
feed the garrison. On the 24th the gallant attempt of
the <i>Julnur</i> was made to run up river with supplies,
and great was the disappointment to see her ashore at
Magasis the next morning. Surrender now appeared
inevitable, the reserve ration had been eaten and men
were actually dying of starvation. Sentries could no
longer stand at their posts, but sat down, and for about
three weeks the Battalions in the trenches had not
been relieved as the men were too weak to move their
equipment, bedding and stores. It was indeed a
pitiful sight to see the men weak and emaciated, but
one was proud that the men of the Battalion kept up
their morale and did their utmost to carry out any
order given.</p>

<p>Owing to weakness everyone lay flat on his back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
whenever possible in order to conserve his strength,
and the line-sick were practically unable to move.</p>

<p>On April 28th and 29th the last emergency ration
was consumed, and on the 29th the garrison surrendered
after a defence of 150 days. Thus ended the siege of
Kut, which had lasted for five months, a period of
hardship and discomfort seldom equalled in the history
of the British Army. The spirit, power of endurance
and courage of the men of the Battalion in the face
of never-ending digging and repairing of trenches,
long hours of night duty, exposure to wet and bitter
cold and starvation, is a wonderful proof of their
soldierly qualities and a fine example to those who
will follow them in the Battalion. The fact that the
siege had ended in capitulation was no fault of theirs
and, by holding on to Kut, they had prevented the
Turkish Army from overrunning Lower Mesopotamia.
The Battalion proceeded by steamer to the Turkish
Camp at Shumran, where it bivouacked on the bank
of the river. The men were in the last stage of
exhaustion and more than fifty per cent. were suffering
from an acute form of diarrhœa. Very little food was
obtained in this camp, and almost entirely consisted
of hard Turkish emergency biscuits. Many men of the
garrison died of starvation or enteritis. Twenty-three
men of the Battalion were passed as unfit to
march by the Turkish doctors. The rest marched
off for Baghdad on the 6th with the remainder of
the Indian garrison; the story of their hardships
and suffering has been related elsewhere. The following
went into captivity and remained prisoners, with
the exception of a few who escaped, for two and
a half years:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Major N. V. L. Rybot, D.S.O.</li>
<li>Captain E. Milford.</li>
<li>Captain S. van B. Laing, M.C.</li>
<li>Captain &amp; Adjutant G. V. R. Reyne.</li>
<li>2nd-Lieutenant O. G. Kiernander, I.A.R.O.<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p></li>
<li>2nd-Lieutenant G. N. Rogers, I.A.R.O.</li>
<li>Captain F. T. Drake-Brockman, 7th Lancers, att.</li>
<li>Captain P. B. Bharucha, D.S.O., I.M.S. (was subsequently exchanged).</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">And about 240 Indian officers, non-commissioned
officers and men.</p>

<p>Although the Battalion had only been actively
engaged since April 12th, 1915, and had had several
short periods of rest, the casualties from enemy action
and sickness (mostly fever), during the seven months to
November 5th, 1915, had necessitated the provision
and absorption of drafts totalling 1,600 men or nearly
twice the original strength of the Battalion.</p>

<p>For services during the siege two Distinguished
Service Orders and nine Indian Distinguished Service
Medals were subsequently awarded to officers and
men of the Regiment.</p>

</div>

<p>During the siege large drafts for the Battalion had
collected with the relieving force, including Lieut.-Colonel
Rodney-Anderson, who had been appointed
Commandant, Lieutenants R. D. E. Darell, E. J. D.
McElwaine, A. H. Dobbs, T. M. Graves, 2nd-Lieutenants
Lechler and Mahoney, Indian Army Reserve
of Officers. The first-named died in hospital, and
Lieutenants Dobbs and Graves were killed in action
with the relieving force. The men were all attached
to the 82nd Punjabis (now 5th Battalion 1st Punjab
Regiment) and the 92nd Punjabis throughout the
operations of the relieving force.</p>

<p>On January 1st, 1917, the Depot of the Battalion
received orders to expand to a battalion and reform
the 76th, the drafts in Mesopotamia being returned to
assist in the making up of numbers. Lieut.-Colonel
W. L. Malcolm, from the 31st Punjabis, was appointed
to command in March, and the Regiment moved to
Chaman for garrison duty there. In November a
nucleus was sent to join the new 2nd Battalion of the
Regiment which was being raised at Nasirabad. This
Battalion eventually did good service on the frontier
in 1919-20 in the Waziristan and Mahsud Campaigns,
being mentioned in despatches. Several officers of
the 76th served in it and it was demobilized in September,
1922, some of the officers and men rejoining the
1st Battalion.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel L. A. Watson, from the 74th Punjabis,
took over command on February 1st, 1918, and in
the same month the Battalion moved to Dera Ismail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Khan and thence to Tank, leaving a depot at the
former place. In June Major J. F. Woodham returned
from service and took command.</p>

<p>The Regiment remained at Dera Ismail Khan and
Tank, from time to time holding the outposts.</p>

<p>While at Tank two-thirds of the Regiment were at
one time in hospital with Spanish influenza, of which
sixty-four died. In December, 1918, and January,
1919, the released Kut prisoners of war rejoined and
were at once sent off to their homes on furlough.
The numbers that rejoined were 8 Indian officers,
183 non-commissioned officers and men, and 17
followers.</p>

<p>The following battle honours were granted to the
Regiment for the Great War:—</p>

<ul>
<li>“Suez Canal,”</li>
<li>“Egypt, 1915,”</li>
<li>“Shaiba,”</li>
<li>“Kut-al-Amarah, 1915,”</li>
<li>“Ctesiphon,”</li>
<li>“Defence of Kut-al-Amarah,”</li>

<p>On war being declared on Afghanistan the Battalion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
was in Dera Ismail Khan with a company at Jandola,
three platoons in other outposts, and one at Tank. A
large draft was received from the 87th Punjabis.
Various detachments were sent out to reinforce
threatened points from time to time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of Jandola.</div>

<p>During May, as many of the Waziristan
Militia deserted and the tribesmen had
risen, it became imperative to evacuate
many of the posts held by the Militia, and
the result was that the company under Captain
Anderson and Lieutenant Proctor in Jandola became
isolated and surrounded by large numbers of hostile
tribesmen.</p>

<p>Owing to the forethought and energy of the commander,
the reserve water tanks in the fort had been
filled, providing water for twelve days, and there were
twenty-six days’ rations available. The water supply
was cut off by the tribesmen on May 28th, on which
day the siege of Jandola commenced.</p>

<p>On the 29th the enemy opened fire on the main fort
and pushed in an attack on a detached tower held by
a party under Havildar Bari Sher, by whom he was
driven off. That night the fort was attacked, as also
was the detached tower, no less than three times, but
all attacks were repulsed. Communication was interrupted
the next day except by means of friendly
Bhittanis. Heavy attacks were again made during
the night May 31st/June 1st. The men now suffered
greatly from thirst, as water was strictly rationed to
two water-bottles a day, and the heat was very great.
Many attempts were made to obtain water, but the
enemy had all sources of supply accurately covered by
fire. Bhisti Gurditt Singh, with great gallantry and
although wounded, several times succeeded in bringing
in water under fire, for which he was later awarded the
Indian Order of Merit.</p>

<p>Continual sniping took place day and night, and
several further attacks took place, but were in each case
driven off with loss. On June 9th the Movable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Column arrived and raised the siege, and the garrison
were relieved and rejoined the Battalion. The
casualties were:—Indian other ranks, 1 died of wounds
and 1 wounded, and 1 follower wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Anderson was awarded the Military Cross
for the able manner in which he had defended the post.
Two Indian Orders of Merit and two Indian Distinguished
Service Medals were awarded to men of the
Regiment, and seven officers and men were mentioned
in despatches for services in the Afghan Campaign.</p>

<p>The complete Battalion concentrated in Tank in
July, and remained there till the end of August, finding
escorts for convoys, and dealing with raiders. In
September it moved to Khirgi, where a month was
spent working on defences and roads, attempting to
round up Mahsud raiders, and day piqueting.
Several men died of cholera.</p>

<p>By October 3rd the Battalion had concentrated at
Darya Khan. The men left for their homes on furlough
preparatory to proceeding to Palestine, and headquarters
was despatched by rail to Dhond.</p>

<p>For its services on the frontier the Battalion was
granted the battle honour “Afghanistan, 1919,” and
General Service Medal, India, 1908, with clasps,
“Afghanistan, North-West Frontier, 1919,” and
“Waziristan, 1919-21.”</p>

<span class="smaller">PALESTINE—3RD BN. 1ST PUNJAB REGIMENT—WAZIRISTAN</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">1920.</div>

<p>The Battalion sailed for Egypt at the end of February
under the command of Major S. van B. Laing,
D.S.O., M.C., and arrived at Sarafend in Palestine
on March 24th, 1920, where it joined the
9th Brigade of the 3rd Lahore Division.</p>

<p>The Depot was left at Dhond, but subsequently
moved to Kirkee, Bellary, and Jhelum before rejoining
the Battalion at Lucknow in 1922.</p>

<p>On April 28th, 1920, the Battalion proceeded to
Haifa, whence, owing to constant raiding by Arabs
from across the Jordan, it despatched detachments
to various places for their protection. A company
was also sent to Cairo to be trained as a Mounted Camel
Company.</p>

<p>A party of Mussalmans was also enabled to perform
the pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1921.</div>

<p>On July 27th the Battalion proceeded to Jerusalem,
whence about half the strength proceeded on detachment
to various towns. The Battalion arrived at
Beni Suef in Egypt in December, and took part in
manœuvres near Cairo in March. In April the
Camel Company, which had been employed on
patrol work between Beersheba and the Dead
Sea, rejoined, and in May the whole Battalion arrived
in Alexandria and provided detachments in and around
that city. The salutary sea air quickly dispelled the
many cases of malaria which were a legacy from the
Jordan Valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1922.</div>

<p>In December, 1921, the Commandant, Lieut.-Colonel
E. Milford, D.S.O., rejoined from leave, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Battalion proceeded to Kantara to await orders to
embark for India. Owing, however, to serious disturbances
in Cairo, the Battalion was hurriedly
despatched thither on Christmas Eve, and remained
there till March 23rd. It then moved to Suez
and embarked for India, arriving at Lucknow
on April 7th, where it was joined by the
Depot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3/1st Punjab Regiment.</div>

<p>In accordance with the Reorganization Scheme, the
Jat Company was now replaced by Rajputs from
Rajputana, and on December 1st the Battalion became
the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Punjab Regiment, the
other battalions being:—</p>

<p>The badges of the Elephant subscribed “Assaye,”
and the Golden Dragon wearing an Imperial Crown,
worn by certain of the battalions, were taken into use
by all battalions of the new Regiment. The uniform
remained scarlet, but the facings were changed to
grass-green.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1923.</div>

<p>The following officers were posted permanently
to the Battalion on reorganization:—</p>

<ul>

<p>During the hot weather the Battalion was honoured
by being selected to provide the Simla detachment to
find the guards on the Residences of His Excellency
the Viceroy, and His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief,
under the command of Major S. van B. Laing,
D.S.O., M.C.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1924.</div>

<p>On November 21st the Battalion left Lucknow and
proceeded to Waziristan, arriving at Razani on
November 30th. Here it remained for six months,
being employed in finding permanent piquets and
road protection parties. It then proceeded
to join the 7th Brigade at Razmak, and on
arrival marched with the Movable Column to
Sarwekai and back. This demonstration march
occupied fourteen days and a certain amount of sniping
was experienced, Subadar Surat Singh and ten other
ranks being wounded.</p>

<p>In August the Battalion proceeded to Tauda China
for a month, where it provided protection and also
working parties in connection with the completion
of the circular road. Two men were wounded during
this period.</p>

<p>In November the Battalion moved with a column to
Piaza Raghza, where it remained for six months performing
protective duties in connection with the
improvement of the road and convoys, and providing
about one company in permanent picquets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>During the Battalion’s tour of duty in Waziristan,
2 men were killed, 1 Indian officer and 13 men wounded,
by enemy action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1925.</div>

<p>In December, 1925, the Battalion, under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel A. F. Harper,
moved to Nowshera in the North-West Frontier
Province, where it formed part of the 4th Brigade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1926.</div>

<p>Thus, in the 150th year of its existence, the
Battalion is serving in Nowshera. Its services
in Waziristan have been rewarded by the grant
of the General Service Medal, India, with a clasp for
“Waziristan, 1921-24,” and it has also been honoured
by again being selected to find the detachment at
Simla during the hot months.</p>
